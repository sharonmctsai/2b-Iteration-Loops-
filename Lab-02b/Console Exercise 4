****Create a new sketch and use a for loop and the println method to print all the even numbers between 2 and 10 to the console.
//Lab-02b
//Console Exercise 4
//for loop print  even numbers between 2 and 10


for (int i= 2; i<=10 ; i+=2)
 {
 println(i);
 
 }

 
****When you have it working using the for loop, refactor your code to use a while loop

//Lab-02b
//Console Exercise 4
//for loop print  even numbers between 2 and 10

int i= 2;
while ( i<=10 )
 {
 println(i);
 i+=2;
 }
