//Create a new sketch and use a while loop and the println method to print hello 5 times to the console.

//Lab-02b
//Console Exercise 1
//while loop print hello 5 times

int i =1;

//When you have it working using the while loop, refactor your code to use a for loop.

//Console Exercise 1
//for loop print hello 5 times
